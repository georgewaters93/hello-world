Hopeless at Coding

Hi all,

My name is George and this is the beginning of my site on GitHub called Hopeless at Coding. The name describes my current ability at coding. I am completely and utterly hopeless. 

I want to imrove my skills by creating a new website each week. GitHub will give me a medium to do so.

Peace out,
GW.
